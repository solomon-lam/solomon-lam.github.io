Question: Can we show the blows up of second moment implies the non-conservation of the first moment in the context of exchange-drive-growth model. 
In the Smoluchowski equation, in Laurenccot's book, Analytic Method for Coagualtion Equation volume 2, chapter/ Lemma 9.2.1, there is a proof, with the idea that the tail of the first moment can be used to control higher moments.

Unforunately, it is not clear how one can adapt this proof for the EDG model. That is the reason we try to look at other literature. The key seems to be a proper control on the tail of the moments.
