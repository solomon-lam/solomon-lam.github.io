# Markov process

Markov process ->(defines via regaular conditional probability wrt filtration) transition functions ->(induces) semigroup on some domain ->(defines) generator 

Kolmogorov's theorem: the connection between "Markov process" and "transition functions"\
Hille-Yisoda: the connection between "strongly continuous contraction semigroup" and "linear operator on a Banach space". \

In discrete time, the martingale problem characterizes the Markov process but in continuous time\
Martingale problem: the solution may not be unique, and not all solutions all Markov processes\
Solution of martingale problem (martingale property of $f(X_t) - \int_0^t \mathcal{L}f(X_s) \mathrm{d} s$ ) -> transition function \
Solution of martingale problem

# Log Sobolev inequality in EDG

Goal: Want to show a Log-Sobolev inequality for EDG process.

Consequence: Exponential Convergence to equilibrium
