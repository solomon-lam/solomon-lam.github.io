Write decompostion in terms of $L=$ entropy + 
Reference: Hoeksema IIa. IIB.

Why one way flux is usual? Net flux is contraction of one way flux, general LDP theory.



Consistency check  $K(k,l)= \overline{K}(k,l)e^{b(k,l)}$, $b$ bounded, non-reversible setting, can we make this work?
Need to conside $\int \rho (k -k^{\dag})$
$d_(c_t,c_s)$
$F(c)=\int c_k c_l K(k,l) (e^{b(k,l)-e^{b(l+1,k-1)}})$

$\int F(c) \bC^{N,L}$,
show $F(c)$ is continuous and bounded under $\d_{Ex}$ convergence.

Hope that the other terms remain lower semi continuous in the non-reversible setting.
