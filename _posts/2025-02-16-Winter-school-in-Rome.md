## Quantum Markov Semigroups in Non-equilibrium Statistical Physics 

This is the collection of summaries in the winter school (Winter school on Statistical Mechanics, Nonequilibrium Processes and Probability) in Rome in 2025.  
Speaker: Eric Carlen

Title Quantum Markov Semigroups in Non-equilibrium Statistical Physics

Day 1: Large N limit of finite systems of N degrees of freedom.
Quantum dynamical system
Question: which generators of QDS on $T(H)$ arising from the coupling of quantum system on $H$ to a reservoir on some limit?  
2. What is the structure of the general generator of a quantum dynamical semigroups on $T(H)$ with $H$ finite dimensional Hilbert space?  
3. Steady state of generator $L^\dagger$ of a QDS  
4. When can we prove
$$D(\rho_t^\dagger| \sigma) \le e^{-ct} D(\rho | \sigma)$$
with an explicit $c$ under detailed balance condition with respect to the steady state $\sigma$.  

Definition of completely positive, superoperator...
