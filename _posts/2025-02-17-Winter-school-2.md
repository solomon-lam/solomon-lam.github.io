## On the Smoluchowski coagulation equation for aggregation phenomena

This is the collection of summaries in the winter school in Rome in 2025.

Speaker: Alessia Nota

Title  On the Smoluchowski coagulation equation for aggregation phenomena

Day 1: Well-posedness, properties, physical relevant cogulation kernels, 
Dynamical scaling solutions

Mass/ moment conservation 

Day2: space-dependent particle model convergence to Smoluchowski equation. 




Bogolouiov theory many body QM
Introduction of second quantization formalism
Idea of Bogolouiov approximation -> Approximation of constant $C$ in 
$N\hat{V}(0)/2 -c \le E_N \le (N+1)/2 \hat{V}(0)$ gives information of BEC. Because order $N$ particles on ground state, $O(1)$ particles in  excited states.
