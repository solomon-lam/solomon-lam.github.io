# First post

I am following the course Practical Deep Learning for Coders, in which they recommend setting up a blog to log my progress. I am convinced this could be helpful in many ways. Hence I started this blog today. This blog would be used to explain things to myself. If someone finds this helpful, then it would be a bonus.

My Japanese name is Toshihiko Hayashi.
