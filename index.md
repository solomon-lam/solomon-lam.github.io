#### Herzlich willkommen in meinem Blog!
My name is Solomon Lam.  
I submitted my thesis on the convergence of exchange-driven stochastic particle system in September 2025. I will defense my thesis in late January 2026. Currently I am working as a full-time intern at the pricing department at an insurance company applying the theory of probability and statistics in my everyday work.  
I hope you enjoy your visit here.
